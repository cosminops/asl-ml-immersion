        "[Grounding in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/ground-gemini) lets you use generative text models to generate content grounded in your own documents and data. This capability lets the model access information at runtime that goes beyond its training data. By grounding model responses in Google Search results or data stores within [Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/enterprise-search-introduction), LLMs that are grounded in data can produce more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grounding provides the following benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reduces model hallucinations (instances where the model generates content that isn't factual)\n",
        "- Anchors model responses to specific information, documents, and data sources\n",
        "- Enhances the trustworthiness, accuracy, and applicability of the generated content\n",
        "\n",
        "You can configure two different sources of grounding in Vertex AI:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Google Search results for data that is publicly available and indexed.\n",
        "   - If you use this service in a production application, you will also need to [use a Google Search entry point](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/grounding-search-entry-points).\n",
        "2. [Data stores in Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-datastore-ingest), which can include your own data in the form of website data, unstructured data, or structured data"

This means the Moon will pass in front of the Sun, but it won't completely cover it. Instead, a bright ring of sunlight will be visible around the Moon's silhouette – often referred to as a \"ring of fire\".\n\n*   **Path:** The path of annularity (where the ring of fire is visible) will stretch across parts of the western United States, including:\n\n    *   Oregon\n    *   California\n    *   Nevada\n    *   Utah\n    *   Arizona\n    *   Colorado\n    *   New Mexico\n    *   Texas\n\n*   **Partial Eclipse:** A partial solar eclipse will be visible across a much wider area of North America, including the rest of the US. This means people outside the path of annularity will still see the Moon cover a portion of the Sun.\n\n**Important Safety Note:** Never look directly at the Sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse. Use certified solar viewing glasses (eclipse glasses) or a handheld solar viewer that meets the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard. Sunglasses are not safe for viewing a solar eclipse.\n\nDo you have any other questions about solar eclipses or astronomy in general? I'd be happy to answer them!\n"

Be open-minded\\nOne of the most important things you can do to be a productive member of an inclusive and diverse workforce is\\nto be open-minded. This means being willing to learn about different cultures and perspectives, and being willing\\nto change your own views when necessary. It also means being respectful of others, even if you disagree with\\nthem. 2. Be respectful\\nRespect is essential for any productive workplace, but it is especially important in an inclusive and diverse\\nworkforce. This means being respectful of other people's cultures, religions, and sexual orientations. It also means\\nbeing respectful of other people's opinions, even if you disagree with them. 3. Be inclusive\\nInclusion is another important part of being a productive member of an inclusive and diverse workforce. This\\nmeans making sure that everyone feels welcome and included, regardless of their background or identity. It also\\nmeans making sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and contribute. 4. Be diverse\\nDiversity is a strength, not a weakness. This means embracing different perspectives and experiences, and using\\nthem to create a more innovative and successful workplace. It also means being willing to challenge your own\\nbiases and assumptions. \\n...\\nCelebrate the diversity of your workplace and\\nthe contributions of all employees. \\n...\\n5. Be yourself\\nFinally, it is important to be yourself in an inclusive and diverse workforce. This means being honest about who you\\nare and what you believe in. It also means being comfortable with your own identity and being proud of who you are. Following these tips will help you to be a productive member of an inclusive and diverse workforce. By being\\nopen-minded, respectful, inclusive, diverse, and yourself, you can help to create a more positive and productive\\nworkplace for everyone. Here are some additional tips for working in an inclusive and diverse environment: Be aware of your own biases. We all have biases, whether we are aware of them or not. It is important to be\\naware of your own biases so that you can work to overcome them. Be open to feedback. If you are working in an inclusive and diverse environment, it is important to be open\\nto feedback. This will help you to learn and grow. Be willing to change. Change is inevitable, especially in an inclusive and diverse environment. Be willing to\\nchange your own views and behaviors when necessary. Be patient. It takes time to build trust and understanding in an inclusive and diverse environment. Be\\npatient with yourself and with others. Celebrate diversity. Diversity is a strength, not a weakness. \", title='Cymbal Bank Company Culture', uri='gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/cymbal-bank-employee/Cymbal Bank Company Culture.pdf'), web=None)] grounding_supports=[GroundingSupport(confidence_scores=[0.98221177], grounding_chunk_indices=[0], segment=Segment(end_index=63, part_index=None, start_index=None, text='Cymbal Bank has a fast-paced, results-oriented company culture.')), GroundingSupport(confidence_scores=[0.8730366], grounding_chunk_indices=[1], segment=Segment(end_index=311, part_index=None, start_index=158, text='Cymbal Bank also strives to have an inclusive and diverse workforce, encouraging employees to be open-minded, respectful, inclusive and to be themselves.'))] retrieval_metadata=None retrieval_queries=['company culture'] search_entry_point=None web_search_queries=None\n"

These are often set up to ensure compliance with travel policies and can streamline expense reporting. For example, the Cymbal Bank Business Travel Guide suggests using tools like \"Cymbal Fly\" for flights, \"Cymbal Stay\" for hotels, and \"Cymbal Drive\" for rental cars.\n\n3.  **Book Flights, Hotels, and Rental Cars:** Whether through a company tool or on your own (if allowed), book your flights, hotels, and any rental cars you might need. When booking, keep in mind factors such as:\n\n    *   **Location:** Choose hotels close to your meeting locations or with good transportation access.\n    *   **Amenities:** Consider if you need amenities like Wi-Fi, a business center, or free breakfast.\n    *   **Loyalty Programs:** Use your loyalty program accounts to earn points and miles.\n"

            "text/markdown": "Okay, let's break down the business travel booking process into greater detail, covering key considerations and steps:\n\n**1. Understanding and Adhering to Company Travel Policy**\n\n*   **Review the Policy:** Obtain and thoroughly read your company's travel policy. This document is your guide and outlines what is expected of you when booking travel.\n*   **Key Elements:** Pay close attention to aspects such as:\n    *   **Approved Booking Channels:** Are you required to use a specific online booking tool, travel agency, or internal travel department?\n    *   **Preferred Vendors:** Does the company have negotiated rates or partnerships with specific airlines, hotels, or car rental companies?\n    *   **Spending Limits:** Are there maximum amounts you can spend on flights, hotels, meals, or other travel expenses?\n    *   ** класу Travel Classes:** Are there restrictions on booking business or first-class flights or suites?\n    *   **Pre-Approval Requirements:** Do you need to obtain approval from your manager or a designated approver before booking travel?\n    *   **Documentation:** What receipts and documentation are required for expense reimbursement?\n\n**2. Choosing Your Booking Method**\n\n*   **Company-Designated Tools:** If your company mandates the use of a specific online booking tool (like Concur, Egencia, or a custom platform), start there. These tools are pre-configured to enforce company policy and may offer negotiated rates.\n*   **Travel Agency:** Some companies prefer you book through a travel agency. The agency can handle all aspects of your travel arrangements, ensure policy compliance, and provide support in case of issues.\n*   **Self-Booking (If Allowed):** If your company allows self-booking, you have more flexibility. However, you are also fully responsible for adhering to company policy. You can use airline/hotel websites, online travel agencies (OTAs) like Expedia or Booking.com, or metasearch engines.\n\n**3. Booking Flights**\n\n*   **Consider Flight Times and Connections:** Choose flights that align with your meeting schedule and minimize travel time. Factor in layovers, potential delays, and time zone changes.\n*   **Compare Prices:** Use multiple sources to compare flight prices. Check airline websites, OTAs, and metasearch engines (like Google Flights or Kayak).\n*   **Airline Loyalty Programs:** If you are not restricted to a specific airline, book with airlines where you have frequent flyer status to earn points and potentially receive upgrades.\n*   **Seat Selection:** Select your seat in advance, if possible. Consider factors like legroom, proximity to restrooms, and aisle vs. window preferences.\n*   **Check Baggage Allowance:** Be aware of baggage allowance restrictions and fees, especially if you plan to check luggage.\n\n**4. Booking Hotels**\n\n*   **Location, Location, Location:** Choose a hotel that is conveniently located near your meeting location, client offices, or public transportation. Consider the commute time, especially during peak hours.\n*   **Business Amenities:** Ensure the hotel offers amenities that are important for business travelers, such as free Wi-Fi, a business center, meeting rooms, early check-in/late check-out options (if needed), and a comfortable workspace in your room.\n*   **Hotel Loyalty Programs:** Book with hotels where you have loyalty status to earn points and receive perks like free upgrades, breakfast, or Wi-Fi.\n*   **Read Reviews:** Check online reviews from other business travelers to get an idea of the hotel's quality, service, and suitability for business trips.\n*   **Negotiated Rates:** Inquire if your company has negotiated rates with specific hotels in the area.\n\n**5. Booking Rental Cars (If Necessary)**\n\n*   **Do You Need a Car?** Consider whether you truly need a rental car. Public transportation, ride-sharing services (like Uber or Lyft), or taxis may be more cost-effective and convenient in some cities.\n*   **Rental Car Companies:** Check prices from multiple rental car companies.\n*   **Insurance:** Understand the insurance coverage provided by the rental car company and your personal auto insurance policy.
